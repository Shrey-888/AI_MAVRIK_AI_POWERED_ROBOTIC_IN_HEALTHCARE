# Project Title : Healthcare Data Cleaning and Analysis


# Group Members 
Patel Shrey, Patel Parth, Patel Manush, Aman Chordia

# Objective 

Using Python and libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to:

1. Clean patient data.


2. Handle missing values effectively.


3. Analyze the cleaned data for meaningful trends in healthcare.


4. Visualize the findings through clear and insightful graphs.

# Tools and Libraries : Panda, NumPy, Matplot.lib

Data source : 

Execution step : 

# Summary of result :

- Displays the first few rows, column names, missing values, and descriptive statistics.
   Cleans column names by removing extra spaces.
- Cholesterol Analysis:
   Fills missing values in the Cholesterol column with the mean.
   Shows summary statistics before and after filling missing values.
- Heart Disease Analysis:
   Groups patients by HeartDisease (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
   Calculates averages for features like Cholesterol, Age, and BloodPressure.
- Visualizations:
   Average Cholesterol vs. Heart Disease: Bar plot to compare cholesterol levels.
   Average Age vs. Heart Disease: Bar plot to analyze age differences.
   Average Blood Pressure vs. Heart Disease: Bar plot for blood pressure trends.
   Average Cholesterol by Age Group: Bar plot to observe cholesterol across age brackets.
